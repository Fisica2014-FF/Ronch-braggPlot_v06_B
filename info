to run:

runAll input particle_events.dat [dump] [stat] [hist h.root]
or
runAll sim 100 [seed 234] [dump] [stat] [hist h.root]
(to simulate 100 events with random seed 234)
Square brackets indicate optional arguments.

other executables are produced:
runDump   - executable with the capability to dump events only
runStat   - executable with the capability to compute pt means/rms only
runHist   - executable with the capability to reconstruct B decays only
