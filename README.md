# Ronch-braggPlot-final

Final exercise for the course C++ and Object Oriented Programming. Analyse particle events and create Bragg Curve plots for the energy loss using [CERN](http://home.cern)'s [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch) framework. It demonstrates a variety of techniques, like some C++11/14 features, and programming patterns, like the Observer and Abstract Factory pattern.
